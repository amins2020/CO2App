        "1. Avoid smoking indoors to improve your indoor air quality. Ban usage of tobacco and "
        "smoking products, which releases CO2 and other chemicals in the air.\n\n"

    <ul>
        "2. Control Humidity Levels:\n\n"
        <li>Make sure to check around the house for water leaks to avoid and stop the growth
            of mould due to dampness.\n\n</li>

        <li>Use a bathroom or kitchen exhaust fan when showering or cooking to reduce
            humidity. Keep the fan on for at least 30 minutes afterward.\n\n</li>

        <li>Use a dehumidifier to remove water from the air, especially in the summer.
            Remove water from dehumidifiers when not in use so bacteria do not grow.\n\n</li>

    </ul>

        "3. If the weather permits and if the room possesses windows, open them to let fresh air "
        "in and circulate around your rooms.\n\n"


        "4. If the home layout permits, make sure household appliances are installed, maintained, "
        "and working according to the manufacturers' instructions: gas water heaters,gas or "
        "oil furnaces, gas or wood stoves, and gas or wood fireplaces.\n\n"


        "5. Clean around the house more often: Clean floors with a damp mop or cloth. Clean the "
        "lint tray every time you use the dryer and check for lint build-up on the outside vent. "
        "Use a mattress and pillow protector. Also, vacuum mattresses and wash sheets once a week "
        "in hot water. Vacuum often. Install a central vacuum that is vented outdoors.\n\n"


        "6. If the house has an attached garage, avoid idling your car, gas-powered or snow blower "
        "in your garage. The carbon monoxide produced by theses objects will reduce the quality of "
        "breathable air. Pollutants can enter your home from the garage whether the garage door is "
        "is open or closed.\n\n"


        "7. Investing in an air purifier can benefit at reducing indoor allergens placing it in "
        "the most commonly used area of the house. However, it does not completely remove"
        "allergens. Certain items can also be invested to improve air quality. For example, beeswax"
        " candles act like air purifiers. Pollen, dust, dirt, pollutants, and any other junk in the "
        "air carry a positive charge, so when a beeswax candle is burning the negative ions "
        "released into the air cause these positively charged particles to be sucked into the "
        "candles or to fall from suspension. A salt lamp, which is a light source put into a "
        "large mass of Himalayan salt, is another object to possess properties that reduce "
        "allergies and asthma symptoms.\n\n"


        "8. Plants are natural purifiers too that can recycle the air from CO2 to oxygen. Here are "
        "several examples of plants that are good for their air filter capabilities: "
        "red-edged dracaena, weeping fig, and bamboo palm."

        "To ensure a safe and breathable environment, here are different levels of CO2 to consider:"
        "\n\n"

        "250-400ppm: Normal background concentration in outdoor ambient air\n\n"

        "400-1,000ppm: Typical concentration level of occupied indoor spaces with good air exchange.
        \n\n"

        "1,000-2,000ppm: Level associated with complaints of drowsiness and poor air.\n\n"

        "2,000-5,000ppm: Headaches, sleepiness and stagnant, stale, stuffy air. Poor "
        "concentration, loss of attention, increased heart rate and slight nausea may also be "
        "present.\n\n"

        "5,000ppm: Indication of unusual air conditions where high levels of other gases could also"
        " be present. Toxicity or oxygen deprivation could occur. This is the permissible exposure "
        "limit for daily workplace exposures. It is recommended that the average concentration over"
        "an 8-hour period should not exceed 5,000 ppm.\n\n"

        "Above 40,000ppm: Exposure may lead to serious oxygen deprivation resulting in permanent "
        "brain damage, coma, or even death.\n\n"
